## Risk Impact Profit Evaluation System

---

Adopting data analysis methodologies originally developed for advanced signal processing.

Utilizes both geospatial and statistical analysis.

**Weak signals** are characteristics that are not readily apparent in any single set of factors but that are predictive of highly successful impact investments.

By using a variety of data sets, each with uncorrelated signals. You can use stacking algorithm to pull a weak signal from the aggregation.

Create overlays of maps with various datasets.

* market access

* growing areas

* population density

**Are there ways to measure whether the maps outputs are correct over time.**

Use geo-spatial representations of data in order to determine the optimal location for certain types of data.

Are there ways to back test this use machine learning to see if predictions of target areas actually yield better results?

Identify the distinct components of risk and profit. Maps those components.

## Environmental Change Poverty and Conflict

Could we scrape local news coverage or twitter feeds of particular areas to get a sense of what the population is thinking in those places.

Z-score measure percent of a standard deviation away from the mean.

Used principal component analysis.
