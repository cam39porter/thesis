Build out simultanouesly for middle output areas

What kind of population of supports a pub?

You can dial in the resolution of the analysis.

Grab health, marriage, age of child, grab the social ones like starbucks, stadiums, ted bike paths, food pricing (at least 10 of these should be non traditional) and no more than 10 economic, and others can characerize the population (religion, dialects), leave 10 as wild cards for combinations

negative correlations are just as predictive
