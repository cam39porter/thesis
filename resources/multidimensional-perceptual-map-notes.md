# A Multidimensional Perceptual Map Approach to Project Prioritization and Selection

> In this research, we present an intuitive visual exploration approach and its instantiation based on the concept of multidimensional perceptual maps (MdPM). The approach addresses the weaknesses of traditional scoring/ranking approaches and visualization approaches, while keeping their simplicity and interpretability. It reveals the values of underlying attributes and makes them transparent in the process of viewing, understanding, and analyzing projects and portfolios [pg. 4]

* This is the same type of decision making we would like to integrate into our geographic information system.

> Most existing perceptual maps are constructed based on two perpendicular axes, which are plotted to represent two chosen dimensions/attributes (Gower et al., 2010). The scale on each axis can be quantitative and continuous, or qualitative and discrete. The mapping space is often conceptually organized into four (2 by 2) or 9 (3 by 3) regions for better business interpretations (Figure 1)

* We can use this kind of quadrant chart to compare the relative value gain by using the MdPM as opposed to other two dimensional techniques.
