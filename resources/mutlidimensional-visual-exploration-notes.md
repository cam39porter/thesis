# A Multidimensional and Visual Exploration Approach to Project Portfolio Management

> Aggregating information about each project into a single numerical value reduces the richness of information about each project to make a decision. [pg. 4]

* This kind of simplicity does not provide the level of information needed for individuals to make informed decisions.

> An aggregated score tends to homogenize many projects, hiding useful and relevant information that may effectively distinguish them (Wang & Yang, 2003). [pg. 4]

* By using a single indicator you actually abstract away useful details that distinguish one entity from another

> Good visualization tools are able to help people to comprehend project portfolios because they can provide direct and intuitive perceptions of complex information and help users to identify patterns and trends (Grinstein & Ward, 2001; Soukup & Davidson, 2002; Tegarden, 1999). [pg. 4]

* Can we provide both a single indicator and a visualization of where that indicator came from. Two targets markets may be equally good, however they may be equally good for different reasons. A single indicator will not capture this but a visualization could.

> Clustering techniques were considered because of their well known capability to deal with multidimensional data (Wang & Yang, 2003). [pg. 12]

* Identify clustering techniques that we are going to use.

* We can use a single indicator in conjunction with self organizing maps in order to provide useful insights along with intuitive explanations.
