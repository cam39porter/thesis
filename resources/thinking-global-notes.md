# Thinking Global: The Route to UK Exporting Success

* Goal => rebalance the economy and narrow our trade deficit

* Lookup *Exporting is GREAT* initiative

> Small and medium sized enterprises (SME) generates 287,000 pounds from export of goods and services [pg. 5]

> "The UK ranks in the bottom  ve across Europe when it comes to the share of all exports accounted for by SMEs despite the fact that the UK is one of the best when it comes to absolute level of exports" [pg. 5]

> "With the value of overall exports stagnating, the UK is set to miss the target set by the Government in 2012 to raise the level of exports to £1 trillion by 2020. The share of SMEs exporting has also declined and the UK ranks in the bottom  ve of European nations for SME exporters" [pg. 6]

> "The chief barriers to exporting cited by SMEs include language and cultural differences, regulatory challenges and a sense that a product or service is not suitable for a particular market." [pg. 6]

* **One of the factors that dissuades exporting is not having a good indicator that the product will suite a market**

> "Although this is partly driven by external factors, the in uence of policy and a targeted approach can still make a difference in the face of weak global demand." [pg. 8]

> "Yet, given the ultra-globalised nature of the UK’s product supply chains, a weakening of the pound also implies higher costs for exporters as some of the inputs used to produce exports will be imported. This, together with the potential for a rise in the cost of imports through increased tariffs, could mean that despite the weakening of the pound, exporters still end up losing competitiveness." [pg. 12]

* weakening pound could be detrimental to exports despite popular belief that a weaker currency leads a lowering trade deficit

> Additionally, estimates from the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on the price sensitivity of UK exports3 suggest that many of the goods and services the UK focuses on are ‘price inelastic’ – meaning that a reduction in price does not generally tend to bring about an increase in demand. The implication is that product differentiation, quality and “brand” are more crucial. [pg. 12]

* Quality and brand are most important meaning that market fit and having indicators to determine that are even more important

> For example, more than half (53%) of SMEs that export currently sell goods and services to the US market, whilst slightly less than half export to Germany (48%) and France (47%). [pg. 16]

* As SME's attempt to expand their exports to new emerging markets, SME's can use and test strategies in the US market that they are more familiar with.

> Admittedly, this average figure masks important cross- industry differences. As Figure 13 below shows, SMEs in the IT and Communications sectors are much more likely to have plans to export (23% had such plans). Similarly, across the Professional and Scientific Service industries, 11% of SMEs said that they have such plans. This still leaves a considerable number of businesses across the UK with no intention to export. [pg. 19]

* We can focuses on finding target markets for products and services that have plans to begin exporting in the near future.

> It is clear from this report that by increasing the value of SME exports, both by encouraging existing exporters to export more and by inspiring new exporters to export for the  rst time, that the UK economy will bene t. Such an economic boost would come at a critical time for the UK economy, as the Government navigates the post-Brexit landscape against the long-term backdrop of a persistent UK trading deficit. [pg. 29]

* This is a critical time to develop a system that enables UK exports.
